# Pearson Chaos Workshop

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/pearson-chaos/assets/images/pearson.png)

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience with Harness Chaos Engineering. Participants will learn how to configure, execute, and analyze chaos experiments, as well as how to automatically evaluate experiment hypothesis through resilience probes.

## Labs

### Lab 1: Configuring the Chaos Infrastructure
Set up your initial chaos engineering environment, configuring the tools and settings needed to begin creating chaos experiments.

### Lab 2: Create Resilience Probes
Learn how to create resilience probes that monitor and report on system behavior, crucial for understanding the impact of faults injected during chaos experiments.

### Lab 3: Create a Chaos Experiment
In this lab, participants will design their first chaos experiment, selecting targets and defining what actions will be introduced to simulate disruptive events.

### Lab 4: Execute and Analyze Experiment Results
Execute the chaos experiment and use the resilience probes to collect data. Learn how to analyze the results to understand the experiment's impact on your system.

### Lab 5: Controlling the Chaos with ChaosGuard
Explore how to leverage ChaosGuard in Harness CE to enforce controls around who, what, when, and where chaos experiments are allowed.
