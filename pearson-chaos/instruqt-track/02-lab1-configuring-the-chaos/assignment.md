title: Lab 1 - Configuring the Chaos Infrastructure
teaser: Setting up your Harness Chaos Environment
notes:
- type: text
  contents: |
    - Chaos engineering is the continuous process of proactively introducing disruptions to systems to assess and improve their resilience against real-world outages.
    - In this first lab you will setup the Chaos Environment that you will use for fault injection in subsequent labs.

First let's select the project that's been created for this workshop <br>
![project_selection.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/assets/images/project_selection.png)

## Now it's time to start creating some chaos!
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/se-workshop-ce/assets/images/ce_module.png)

Select the **Chaos Engineering** module from the list <br>

> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/se-workshop-ce/assets/images/ce_nav_environments.png)
> ### Click on **Environments** in the left Nav
> - Click `+New Environment` \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/se-workshop-ce/assets/images/ce_new_environment.png)

> **New Environment**
> - Name: <pre>`lab`</pre>
> - Environment Type: `Non-Production`
> - Click **Create**

<br>

> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/se-workshop-ce/assets/images/ce_lab_environment.png)
> ### Now click on the environment we just created.
> - Select Infrastructure type: `Kubernetes`
> - Click `+New Infrastructure` \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/se-workshop-ce/assets/images/ce_new_infrastructure.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We will NOT be using a Harness Delegate for this Lab.
> - Please Select `No` \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/se-workshop-ce/assets/images/ce_new_infrastructure_v1_or_v2.png)
> - Click **Next >** and configure with the details below â†“

> **New Infrastructure**
> - **Overview**
>   - Name: <pre>`lab-hce`</pre>
>   - Click **Next >**
> - **Configure**
>   - Installation Type: `Kubernetes`
>   - Access Type:

>     - Select `Specific namespace access` \
>         ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/se-workshop-ce/assets/images/ce_enable_infra_namespace.png)
>   - Installation Location (Namespace): <pre>`[[ Instruqt-Var key="HARNESS_USER_NAME" hostname="sandbox" ]]`</pre>
>   - Service Account Name: `hce`
>   - Click **Next >**
> - **Deploy the setup**
>   - You will `skip` *Create the namespace* and *Apply the Chaos CRDs* as this is handled for you in this workshop
>   - Click **Download**
> - Click **Done**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The namespace ***MUST*** be `[[ Instruqt-Var key="HARNESS_USER_NAME" hostname="sandbox" ]]` which is your individual namespace for this workshop

> [!NOTE]
> Don't worry about applying the downloaded manifest as we execute the `kubectl apply -f lab-hce-harness-chaos-enable.yml` command for you
