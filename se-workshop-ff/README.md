# Harness FF Instruqt Workshop

![Harness FF](https://developer.harness.io/img/icon_ff.svg)

## Introduction

This workshop is intended for two general personas:

- Feature Flag Developer / Feature Flag Administrators
- (planned) Feature Flag “toggler”

For both personas the intent is to provide a curated walkthrough for key feature flag use cases with adequate depth for a developer. The intention of both tracks is to allow each persona to see the “why” of feature flags, and specifically Harness Feature Flags (OPA, Pipelines). 

The developer track is moderately technical with technical aptitude in coding and container builds from attendees and instructor. The intent of the deeper technical track is to allow developers to understand the nuts and bolts of the process, lowering the learning curve on any POV or additional training.

### Languages/Frameworks Covered
- Python
- Typescript (Builds to Javascript)

## Labs

### Lab 1: Feature Releases "the old way"
In this lab, participants will 
1. Familiarize themselves with the application they will be using the upcoming labs

3. Try to rollback to a stable state

### Lab 2: Feature Release with Feature Flags
In this lab you will re-release again but this time behind a flag, with automatic rollback.

### Lab 3: Targeted Feature Releases

### Lab 4: Governance & Efficiency
