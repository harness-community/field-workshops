# Harness IDP Instruqt Workshop

![Harness IDP](https://developer.harness.io/img/idp.svg)

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience with Harness Internal Developer Portal. Participants will learn how to create service components, how dependency relationships are defined, create custom scorecards and refine their weights and metrics, create self-service workflows, and associate pipelines with service components. As a bonus, participants will also explore the new Cloud Developer Environments feature, which provide secure remote development environments that reduce toil and make developers happy.

## Labs

### Lab 1 - Clone the IDP Repo
In this first lab, participants will clone the IDP repo that we will use in subsequent labs.

### Lab 2 - Add a Service Component
In this lab, participants will learn how to add a new service component to the Internal Developer Portal (IDP). This will include defining the component, linking it to relevant resources, and ensuring it is discoverable within the portal.

### Lab 3 - Create a Scorecard
In this lab, participants will create a scorecard to evaluate their services or components based on predefined criteria. Scorecards provide visibility into performance, reliability, and compliance metrics, allowing teams to prioritize improvements.

### Lab 4 - Create a Self-Service Workflow
In this lab, participants will build a self-service workflow that automates routine tasks, enabling developers to perform operations such as deployments, rollbacks, or creating environments with minimal intervention.

### Lab 5 - Add Pipeline Relationships
In this lab, participants will add pipeline relationships to their components in the IDP. This includes connecting CI/CD pipelines to services, ensuring end-to-end visibility for deployments and changes.

### Lab 6 - Cloud Developer Environments Beta
In this lab, participants will explore Harness Cloud Developer Environments (Beta), which provide on-demand, ephemeral development environments in the cloud. Participants will learn to configure and use these environments for efficient cloud-native development workflows.
