## Instruqt 101
Every track has a few key components: <br>
- **config.yml**
  - For a basic workshop this will not require any modification.
- **track.yml**
  - This only requires a few updates and controls how your track is rendered in Instruqt.
  - ![Instruqt Track](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/main/aaa-se-workshop-template/assets/images/EXAMPLE.png)
- **track_scripts**
  - `setup-sandbox`
    - This script contains the standard setup required for every Instruqt track.
    - ðŸŸ¥ Do NOT modify any of it.
      - This script creates a user in Keycloak and then creates a project for that user in Harness
    - If you need to add any configuration specific to your workshop add it after line `#80`
  - `cleanup-sandbox`
    - This script cleans up everything that was provisioned as part of the Instruqt track.
    - ðŸŸ¥ Do NOT modify any of it.
    - If you need to clean up any configuration specific to your workshop add it after line `#44`

**instruqt-track**
- Every lab will have it's own folder which will contain four files.
  - `assignment.md` This is the lab guide the attendees will follow
  - `setup-sandbox` This contains any additional setup required for this individual lab
  - `check-sandbox` This contains any programmatic validation you wish to occur when the user clicks the ***Check*** button
  - `solve-sandbox` This contains any automation to perform the steps for the user. Only necessary if you allow the user to ***Skip***
- Name the folder using the same value as the ***slug*** from `assignment.md` prefixed with its numerical position in the workshop sequence.
- Focus on the `assignment.md` file first and do not worry about any validation until after your content and flow is finalized.

### Install Instruqt CLI
- [Set up Instruqt](https://docs.instruqt.com/getting-started/set-up-instruqt#step-3-set-up-your-chosen-tool) <br>
- [CLI Commands](https://docs.instruqt.com/reference/cli/commands#instruqt-track-push) <br>
Once the CLI is installed run ```instruqt auth login``` to authenticate <br>
Then `cd` to your `instruqt-track` folder and run ```instruqt track push``` to push your track to the Instruqt platform <br>

## Harness Tracks
- **assets**
   - This is where any track specific assets go. Refer to the IaCM workshop as an example.
- **instruqt-track**
  - `01-logging-into-your-harness-sandbox-account`
    - Every workshop should start with this track. You should not need to change anything about it.
    - The workshop provisions a user in Keycloak and then leverages JIT to create the user in Harness the first time they login.
    - The `check-sandbox` script will verify that the user has actually logged in prior to allowing them to continue.
  - `02-lab1-your-lab-name-here`
    - Rename this folder to match the name of your first lab.
    - Now that the user exists in Harness, the `setup-sandbox` script will assign admin permissions to the Harness project we've created for the user.
    - ðŸŸ¥ Do NOT modify this script.
