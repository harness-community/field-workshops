## Now let's explore `Cost Estimation`
> **Configure Workspace**
> - Click the **pencil** icon next to `instance_type`
> - Change the value to <pre>`t3.micro`</pre>
> - Click âœ… to save this variable

### Let's rerun our provision pipeline to deploy this change
> - Click on **Pipelines** in the left Nav
> - Click on your `IaCM Provision` pipeline
> - Now click **Run** \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/assets/images/pipeline_run.png)
> - Then select your `demoworkspace` **Workspace** to execute the pipeline
> - Click **Run Pipeline**

<br>

> - Wait for your pipeline to reach the **Approval** step
> - Click **Review** and let's examine the detailed information \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_pipeline_review.png)
> - First the `Monthly Cost Change` details what the cost impact of your update will be \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_cost_change_estimation.png)
> - You can also expand the `aws_instance` **Resource Type** to see the detail for your individual **EC2 instances**
> - Scroll down from here and select one of your **EC2 instances** from the list \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_planned_changes.png)
> - Scroll down in this list to see the details of the planned change and the `New Value` vs. the `Old Value` \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_instance_type_update.png)

> Click **Approve** and the pipeline will proceed with the **apply** step \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_approve.png)

<br>

## Now let's explore the `State Comparison` feature
> - Click on **Workspaces** in the left Nav
> - Click on your workspace
> - From here click on the  **State** tab \
>     ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_state_tab.png)
>   - You should see two versions here
>   - Select the most recent version in the list
>   - Click the dropdown and select the prior version to compare against \
>       ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_state_compare_with.png)
>   - You can now easily see a side-by-side comparison with the differences highlighted \
>       ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harness-community/field-workshops/harness-se/se-workshop-iacm/assets/images/iacm_state_compare.png)

> [!NOTE]
> The Harness IaCM module keeps a version of state for every successful apply to make it easy to track changes over time
