# Harness IaCM Instruqt Workshop

![Harness IaCM](https://developer.harness.io/img/iacm_landing.svg)

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience with Harness Infrastructure as Code Management. Participants will learn how to create workspaces, build pipelines, detect configuration drifts, and enforce governance using Open Policy Agent (OPA).

## Labs

### Lab 1: Creating a Workspace
In this lab, participants will learn how to create and configure a workspace in Harness IaCM. This will serve as the foundation for the subsequent labs, where you will manage your infrastructure as code.

### Lab 2: Create a Harness IaCM Pipeline
Learn how to create a pipeline in Harness IaCM. This lab will cover the basics of pipeline configuration, including how to trigger deployments and manage infrastructure changes effectively.

### Lab 3: Drift Detection with Harness IaCM
This lab focuses on detecting configuration drifts in your infrastructure. Participants will learn how to set up drift detection, interpret its results, and understand the impact of drift on infrastructure management.

### Lab 4: Governance with OPA
Explore how to integrate Open Policy Agent (OPA) with Harness IaCM to enforce governance policies. This lab will demonstrate setting up policy-as-code frameworks to ensure compliance across your infrastructure deployments.

### Lab 5: Cost Estimation and State Changes
In this lab you will learn how to utilize Harness IaCM to estimate costs and track state changes in your infrastructure, enabling more informed decision-making.
